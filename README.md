(note, pseudo cool language is malice because I can)

# what da fuck is dat?

This is a library with all stuff which I can't put into an library category and which appear in multiple projects.

# Why is it written in D?

Because its not a bad language and because I can.

# Why doesn't this library have a proper name?

Because its just an utility lib.
